Project #3 - Cookware Website
We were tasked to recreate the prototype from the figma given. We also had to do one section with only bootstrap, a section with only grid, and a section with only flexbox.
Peer Review: Gianpaolo Reinares
> Comments: Site looks got at XXXL and 500px widths;
> - In 'Start Cooking' either try to set the grid to be 2x2 around the 1800px mark as they begin to squish into one another, or shrink them down.
> - In 'New Arrivals, the sections are more or less causing the rest of the site to get squashed; I would suggest either shrinking the sections down if you still want the two right next to each other, or since you are using flexbox in that section, just turn it into a column.
> - In 'Best Sellers' the cards end up overlaping one another. Either add some col-12 at the right dimension in order to stack them on top of one another, or shrink them down
> - In 'Reviews', Don't forget to center the text in the h2's; also in 500px, the boxes with text could be a bit lower;
> - For the Header, if you want to match the figma better, I would suggest looking into the 'Offcanvas' section of the 'Navbar' page on GetBootstrap.
> Overall, the site just needs some responiveness work between 1800-500px. But besides that, everything else looks great within certain dimensions.

update: I used GP's advice on the offcanvas, so that helped a lot. I also fixed the h2's in the reviews so now they are centered correctly.
